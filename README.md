Jupiter Internal Banking Software Documentation

Jupiter is designed to be a user-friendly desktop program used to view and manipulate client and account information. It handles all basic banking functions such as deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and cashing of checks. This is software that is to be run internally, it is not intended for a given bank’s client use.

When the program begins, the user is prompted to sign in with a banker username and password, or if it’s the first time, he/she can create a new banking account.

The main screen after signing in is the “Client Search” screen this screen allows a banker to look up a client using their name, account number, or social security number. A Client can then be selected to move onto their “Client Profile” screen.

The “Client Profile” screen allows the banker to view this client’s personal information, as well as the accounts the client has with the bank. The client information can be edited here, or an account can be selected to move to the “Account Profile” screen.

The “Account Profile” Screen allows the banker to view all important information about a bank account. This information includes account balance, type of account, recent transactions, etc. The account profile is also where cashing checks, deposits, withdrawals, and transfers can be completed.

At the top right of any of these screens is a dropdown menu that has links to various screens. These are: Balance Drawer, Reverse Transaction, change password, client search, and sign out.

The “Balance Drawer” Screen keeps track of how much money a banker should have in his drawer based on how much cash has come in or out. A banker can enter into various fields the amount of each denomination he has, then Jupiter displays if they are over, under, or balanced. 

The “Reverse Transaction” screen simply shows a list of all the transactions that a banker has made. The banker can go in and reverse transactions that were made earlier.

The “change password” screen allows a banker to change his login password. 

The “sign out” button takes the banker back to the login screen.
